Usually in the world experience there is no need for a title for test tests. The title sheet is used for the types of exams, in which the essay, essay or similar name-sharif is clearly indicated. In the test, however, there are several options, which are required by the applicant â€œA, B, C... one option that is found to be correct from is fixed. The indication of the name-patronymic does not affect the process. The answers are determined by Keys. Even if the appeal is addressed with the application,the options will be considered, depending on the answers specified.In order to prevent corruption and ensure transparency, we inform you that the testing processes are being sealed to the video recording.",
